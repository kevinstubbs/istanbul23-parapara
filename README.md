Project initially started with these:
- A rainbowkit starter template for the website (https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-next-mint-nft)
- A foundry project for on-chain contracts from worldcoin (https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter)
- HRMI dataset from https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/download-the-dataset-2/ and their DPG registration can be found at https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10388

They were initially checked in with their original names and re-named afterwards for clarity of origin.
